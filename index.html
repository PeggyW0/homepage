        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently interning in Department MakerWorld at Shenzhen Tuozhu Technology Co.,Ltd. [<a href="https://bambulab.com/en-eu">Bambu Lab</a>] as a <strong>Mechanical Design Intern</strong>. I received my MPhil degree in <strong>Computer and Information Engineering</strong> at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), China.
          During my master’s studies, I conducted research on modular self-reconfiguring robots in the 
          <a href="https://freeformrobotics.org/">Freeform Robotics</a> under the supervision of 
          <a href="https://www.freeformrobotics.org/tllam/">Prof. Tin Lun LAM</a>.<br><br>
          I received my bachelor’s degree in <strong>Mechanical Design, Manufacturing, and Automation</strong> from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), China, where I completed my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of 
          <a href="https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/renweihong">Prof. Ren Weihong</a>, focusing on multi-object tracking.<br><br>
          I am currently seeking PhD positions in mechatronics and robotics.

          <h3>SnailBot</h3>
          <p>
            SnailBot is a bionic snail-inspired robot. This version of SnailBot adopts an adaptive spherical gripper structure to enhance inter-module connections and employs a rigid magnetic track as the locomotion mechanism, which also provides a fundamental guarantee for reliable connections between SnailBot modules.

          <h3>CyberBonsai</h3>
          <p>
            This is a 4 + 3 DoF CyberBonsai inspired by network aesthetics, and it is one of the projects I worked on during my internship at Bambu Lab.
            The two trunk joints are driven through cable actuation, while the leaf cluster opens and closes via miniature stepper motors.
            I independently completed the overall structural and hardware design, and I am currently developing the control program to enable vivid, lifelike motion.<br><br>
